Code of Conduct
===

As contributors and maintainers of the brian.singles project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, attending parties, snuggling, holding hands, longing stares, kisses both shallow or deep, intense physical contact, and any other activities.

Communication through any of Brian's channels (GitHub, IRC, mailing lists, Google+, Twitter, chat.meatspac.es, agreed-upon safeword, text message, in-person etc.) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harrassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the brian.singles project to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the brian.singles project may take action: removing issues, comments, and PRs, blocking accounts, sulking, not returning calls or texts, or completely severing contact as deemed appropriate.

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact a responsible member of the brian.singles community.
